We use packaging profile so that you can play with the settings and modify them according to your needs. 

You should now see a new packaging profile in the **Packaging Profiles** section and you can modify the settings according to your needs.

### Login to Steamworks Backend

To generate a token for the One Click Package and Deploy feature, you need to login to the Steamworks backend.

On the main toolbar, click on SIK > Login to Steamcmd. This will open a popup window where you need to enter your SteamGuard code (if enabled) and then click on **Login**.

This is a one-time process and you don't need to login again unless you logout or the token expires.
