The Steam Integration Kit is a powerful plugin designed for Unreal Engine 5, allowing developers to fully leverage the Steam SDK within Blueprints. With this plugin, you can seamlessly integrate Steam's features into your game, including achievements, leaderboards, multiplayer matchmaking, and more, all without needing to write a single line of C++ code. Ideal for indie developers and studios looking to streamline their development process, the Steam Integration Kit offers a robust and user-friendly interface to bring your games to life on Steam.

## Marketplace vs GitHub Version

The Steam Integration Kit is available on both the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/steam-integration-kit) and [GitHub](https://github.com/betidestudio/SteamIntegrationKit). Let's compare the two versions:

- The Github version has to be compiled from source, while the Marketplace version is a pre-compiled plugin.
- Almost all Steam SDK interfaces are available in both versions.
- The Marketplace version is more user-friendly and easier to install and also supports us to continue developing the plugin.

Now some major differences:

- One Click Deployer is available only in the Marketplace version because it uses the Steam SDK binaries, which are not available in the GitHub version.
- The GitHub version uses the Online Subsystem Steam plugin coming with the Unreal Engine, while the Marketplace version uses the modified version of the same.
    **This helps us to support latest version of Steam SDK on the Marketplace version.**
- Now because the Marketplace version uses the modified version of the Online Subsystem Steam plugin, we have many fixed bugs and added new features which are not available in the GitHub version.
- [Coming in Next Update] The Marketplace version uses a single Netdriver for both the Steam and Non-Steam versions of the game, which is not available in the GitHub version.
