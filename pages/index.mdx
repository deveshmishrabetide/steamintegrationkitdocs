## Marketplace vs GitHub Version
The Steam Integration Kit is available on both the Unreal Engine Marketplace and GitHub. Below is a comparison of the two versions:

### Common Features
- Steam SDK Interfaces: Both versions provide access to nearly all Steam SDK interfaces.
- Ease of Use: The Marketplace version is pre-compiled and much more user-friendly, while the GitHub version requires you to compile the plugin from source.
- Support: Purchasing the Marketplace version helps support further development of the plugin.
### Key Differences

#### Installation:

- Marketplace Version: Pre-compiled for easy installation.
- GitHub Version: Requires manual compilation from source.
#### One Click Deployer:

Available only in the Marketplace version, as it relies on Steam SDK binaries, which are not included in the GitHub version.

#### Steam SDK Support:
The Marketplace version uses a modified version of the Online Subsystem Steam plugin, allowing it to support the latest Steam SDK versions. The GitHub version uses the standard plugin that comes with Unreal Engine, which may not support the latest SDK updates.

#### Bug Fixes and New Features:
The Marketplace version benefits from bug fixes and additional features that are not available in the GitHub version, thanks to its modified Online Subsystem Steam plugin.

#### Unified NetDriver:
The Marketplace version uses a single NetDriver for both Steam and Non-Steam game versions, offering smoother integration. This feature is not available in the GitHub version.

#### Priority Support:
Marketplace users receive priority support, ensuring faster assistance and more direct troubleshooting compared to the GitHub version.
