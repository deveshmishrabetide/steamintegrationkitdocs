# Dedicated Server sessions
Dedicated server sessions are a way to host a game server on a dedicated server. This is the most common and secure way to implement multiplayer.

## Introduction

Dedicated servers are the most common way to implement multiplayer in games. They are:

- Secure
- Scalable
- Reliable

## How it works

Dedicated servers are game servers that run on a dedicated machine. This machine is usually hosted by a third-party service provider or a virtual machine. The game server is responsible for:

- Hosting the game
- Managing the game state
- Handling player connections


## Requirements

To host a dedicated server, you will need:

- A dedicated machine
- A game server build which can only be made from Source Engine. More info can be found [here](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/game_servers).


## Creating Dedicated Server Session
