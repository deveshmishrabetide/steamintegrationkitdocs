# Friends

Friends are players you have added to your friends list. You can see when they are online and invite them to join your game.

## Get Friend list

To get the list of friends, you first need to get the number of friends you have and then you can just iterate over the list of friends.

These functions will return the information of the friend like their name, avatar, etc.

## Invite Friend

This one is interesting. You can invite your friend to join your game. You can use the below function to invite your friend.

In this example, we are inviting a friend to join our lobby but again, you can use this function to invite your friend to join your game OR you can use connect string too!
